# Encrypter

- A program for encrypting files using Huffman coding
A program that can encrypt a file using Huffman coding is a useful tool for protecting sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access to it. Huffman coding is a technique for lossless data compression, which encodes data in a way that reduces its size while preserving its original content.

- To encrypt a file using Huffman coding, the program first analyzes the contents of the file to determine the frequency of each symbol or character in the file. It then uses this information to create a binary tree, where the most frequent symbols are at the top and the least frequent symbols are at the bottom. The program then assigns a unique code to each symbol, based on its position in the tree, with shorter codes assigned to the more frequent symbols.

- Once the codes have been generated, the program applies them to the original file to create an encoded version of the file. This encoded version is typically much smaller than the original file, and is also more difficult for unauthorized users to decipher. The program can also provide a decoder, which allows authorized users to decode the encoded file and access its original contents.

- Overall, a program that can encrypt a file using Huffman coding is a powerful and efficient tool for protecting sensitive data. It can significantly reduce the size of a file while maintaining its integrity, and can provide strong encryption to prevent unauthorized access.
